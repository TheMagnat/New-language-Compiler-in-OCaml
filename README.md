# New-language-Compiler-in-OCaml
  This is a final project for my course of interpretation and compilation.

# Compiling

  $ ocamlbuild -use-menhir liec.byte
  
# Run

  $ ./liec.byte <The file to compile>
  
  
# Note

Since this project was made for a French course, all the comments and the PDF will be in French.
